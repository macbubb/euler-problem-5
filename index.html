	<h1>Smallest Multiple (Euler 5)</h1>
	<div><p>"2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.  What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?</p>
		<p>I solved this one by finding the prime factors of each required factor. Then I made a super set that included all the prime factors including the powers, for example, 2<sup>3</sup> for 8 or 3<sup>2</sup> for 9. The numbers get up there pretty fast! Go ahead and give it a try with n = 20, or whatever else, the function can handle it.</p>
